RustBox is a portable, lightweight Rust development environment for Windows,
designed to provide full MSVC ABI compatibility without requiring a Visual
Studio installation.

It offers a Linux-like CLI workflow on Windows by bundling a minimal Rust
toolchain, MSVC components, and Windows SDK headers/libs into a single,
relocatable directory.
